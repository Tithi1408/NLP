# Machine Learning and NLP 

This repository contains implementations of somw of the Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and models. The focus is on building classifiers, calculating probabilities, and creating language models for text-based tasks.

## Concepts

### 1. **Naive Bayes Classifier (From Scratch)**
- A custom implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm.
- Classifies data based on Bayes' Theorem with assumptions of feature independence.

### 2. **Logistic Regression (Using scikit-learn)**
- Implements Logistic Regression for binary and multi-class classification tasks.
- Built using the `scikit-learn` library for simplicity and efficiency.

### 3. **Probability of a Sentence**
- A program to calculate the probability of a given sentence.
- Useful for language modeling and evaluating sentence structures.

### 4. **Language Model for Word Prediction**
- A basic language model designed to predict the next word in a sentence.
- Demonstrates the application of NLP concepts for text prediction.
